Assignment 1:
The program creates two directories named "welcome_dir_1" and "welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2", using the mkdir call.
Then, it creates a file named "welcome_file.txt" inside the "/welcome_dir_2" directory
and writes the string "welcome to OS-2023" to the file using the write system call.
It then then closes the file using the close system call. Finally, it deletes the file and the 2 directories
using the unlink and rmdir system call.
In between these operations, the program makes various other system calls, such as access,
openat, mmap, mprotect, munmap, and arch_prctl, which are used for memory management and loading shared libraries.
